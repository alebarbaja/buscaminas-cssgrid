# Buscaminas (only visual)

This side project is important to me because it was the first exercise that I presented at a Alicante Frontend Meetup, when I wasn't working on web development yet.

This event opened the doors for me to the front end community in Alicante and through this I found my first job as a UI Developer.

Revisiting the code nowadays I would do things differently, but considering the context of those days, I'm proud enough to leave the code as it is.
